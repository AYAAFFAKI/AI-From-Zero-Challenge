🧠 AI From Zero Challenge Welcome to my 12-week challenge to build Artificial Intelligence from scratch. This repository documents my personal journey to deeply understand and implement core Machine Learning and Deep Learning algorithms — step by step, from the simplest models to advanced neural networks.

🎯 Goal To strengthen my understanding of how AI truly works by coding each algorithm from scratch before using any libraries. By the end of this challenge, I’ll have built a complete foundation in AI and a strong portfolio of original projects.

🗓️ Timeline (12 Weeks Roadmap) Week Topic Algorithm / Focus 1 Linear Regression Gradient Descent & Prediction 2 Logistic Regression Binary Classification 3 Perceptron & Activation Functions Neural Basics 4 KNN & Naive Bayes Simple Classifiers 5 Decision Tree Information Gain & Entropy 6 Random Forest Ensemble Learning 7 SVM Kernel Trick & Margins 8 PCA & Feature Scaling Dimensionality Reduction 9 Neural Network Backpropagation from scratch 10 CNN Image Classification 11 RNN / LSTM Sequential Data 12 Autoencoder / GAN Creative Deep Learning

🧩 Tools & Libraries Python, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib (Later) Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, or PyTorch

📚 Structure Each folder contains: 📘 Explanation (Theory + Notes) 💻 Implementation from scratch ⚙️ Implementation using a library 🧠 Summary & results

🚀 Vision “Don’t just use AI — build it.” This challenge is about mastering the core ideas behind intelligent systems and proving that real understanding starts from zero.
